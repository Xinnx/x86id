# x86id
A small utility to read the information provided by the CPUID instruction seperate from the included cpuid support in gcc (cpuid.h)

At this time I have only tested the program on intel processors and I am aware that AMD processors will not work correctly with this program.

I have done some testing with MinGW and x86id seems to work on Windows as well (for now)

# Building
Build the normal way you build CMake projects, I recommend building in a seperate directory.
